# CouchDBEx

This is supposed to be the *good* couchdb interface for elixir,
documented, tested and other things, but that's in progress for now, i know
there are erlang and elixir clients already, but they are basically dead and not
documented very good if at all, so i'm writing this one.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `couchdb_ex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:couchdb_ex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/couchdb_ex](https://hexdocs.pm/couchdb_ex).
